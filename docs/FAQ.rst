ðŸ•· EOmaps with Spyder IDE
-------------------------

To use the whole potential of EOmaps with the awesome `spyder IDE <https://www.spyder-ide.org>`_  ,
the plot-settings must be adjusted to ensure that ``matplotlib`` plots remain interactive.

- By default, plots are rendered as static images into the "plots-pane"... to avoid this and create
  interactive ``matplotlib`` widgets instead, go to the preferences and set the "Graphics backend" to "Automatic" :
