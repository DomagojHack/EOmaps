ðŸ•· Using EOmaps with the Spyder IDE
-----------------------------------

To use the whole potential of EOmaps with the awesome `spyder IDE <https://www.spyder-ide.org>`_  ,
the plot-settings must be adjusted to ensure that ``matplotlib`` plots remain interactive.

- By default, plots are rendered as static images into the "plots-pane"... to avoid this and create
  interactive ``matplotlib`` widgets instead, go to the preferences and set the "Graphics backend" to "Automatic" :

ðŸ““ Using EOmaps with Jupyter Notebooks
--------------------------------------

While EOmaps works best with matplotlib's ``Qt5Agg`` backend, most of the functionalities work
reasonably well if you want the figures embedded in a Jupyter Notebook.


ðŸ”¸ For jupyter-lab (and classic notebooks) you can use the ``ipympl`` backend

- To install, simply use ``conda install -c conda-forge ipympl``
- Once it's installed, (and before you start plotting) use the magic ``%matplotlib widget`` to activate the backend.
- See here for more details: https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl

ðŸ”¸ For classical notebooks, there's also the ``nbagg`` backend provided by matplotlib

- To use it, simply execute the magic ``%matpltolib notebook`` before starting to plot.

ðŸ”¸ Finally, you can also use the magic ``%matplotlib qt`` and use the ``qt5agg`` backend within Jupyter Notebooks!

- This way the plots will NOT be embedded in the notebook but they are created as separate widgets.
