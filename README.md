# maps

a general-purpose library to plot maps of large non-rectangular datasets.

(it's a work-in-progress... feel free to contribute!)

### features
- plot data-points as ellipses or rectangles with actual geographical dimensions
- reproject data
- interact with the dataset via "callback-functions"
- add overlays to the plots (NaturalEarth features, geo-dataframes, etc.)
- get a nice colorbar with a colored histogram on top
